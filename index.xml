      <description>I am currently a researcher in the Autonomous Systems group at Microsoft. My areas of focus are aerial robotics, autonomous localization/planning, computer vision and machine learning.
In 2019, I received my PhD from the Texas A&amp;amp;M University, where I was part of the Unmanned Systems Lab, headed by Dr. Srikanth Saripalli. My PhD thesis was about collaborative localization and navigation for groups of vision based unmanned aerial vehicles. During my PhD years, I spent the summer of 2016 as a robotics intern in Millennium Engineering at the NASA Ames Research Center.</description>

      <description>Data-driven Sensor Simulation for Realistic LiDARs  Contrastive Multimodal Pretraining for Autonomous Systems  3DB: A Framework for Debugging Computer Vision Models  Representation Learning and Reinforcement Learning for Event Cameras Event-based cameras are dynamic vision sensors that can provide asynchronous measurements of changes in per-pixel brightness at a microsecond level. This makes them significantly faster than conventional frame-based cameras, and an appealing choice for high-speed navigation. While an interesting sensor modality, this asynchronous data poses a challenge for common machine learning techniques.</description>
