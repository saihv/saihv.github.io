                                    I am currently a PhD candidate at the Texas A&M University and a research assistant in the <a href="https://unmanned.tamu.edu">Unmanned Systems Lab</a>, headed by <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/people/saripalli">Dr. Srikanth Saripalli</a>. My primary research deals with collaborative localization and navigation for groups of unmanned aerial vehicles through vision. Alongside, I have also worked briefly on unmanned ground vehicles, humanoid robots, computer vision for intelligent systems and deep learning.

                                    Part of my PhD program was at the Arizona State University, where I was a research assistant in the Autonomous Systems Research Lab, also under Dr. Saripalli. During my PhD years, I spent the summer of 2016 as a robotics intern in Millennium Engineering at the NASA Ames Research Center. As an intern, I helped develop localization and autonomous navigation pipelines for a quadrotor platform in challenging GPS-denied environments.

                                    Prior to my PhD, I received my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from the Arizona State University in 2013. During these years, I was part of the Extreme Environment Robotics Lab (EERL) at ASU, headed by the late <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Alberto_Behar/">Dr. Alberto Behar</a>. As part of the EERL team, I worked on developing software and low-level firmware for the <a href="http://www.wissard.org/node/259">Micro Subglacial Lake Exploration Device</a> (MSLED), an underwater robot for exploring subglacial lakes in Antarctica that was deployed as part of the Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling (WISSARD) expedition. Parallelly, I was involved in developing hardware and software for a remote volcano monitoring system named <a href="https://dtm.carnegiescience.edu/research/projects/bento">BENTO</a>, for which project I was also the team lead. During my master's, I also worked as a Firmware Engineering Intern at the Intel Corporation during the summer of 2013: where I designed low level firmware for the Intel's BioSport headset.

                                In this part of my research, I investigate the idea of collaborative uncertainty-aware path planning for vision based micro aerial vehicles. For vehicles that are equipped with cameras and can localize collaboratively, a set of heuristics are defined which, when given an image or a set of images, can encode the quality of localization of the vehicles that can be obtained using them. Evolutionary algorithms are integrated with an RRT based path planning framework to result in plans which allow the vehicles to navigate intelligently towards areas that can improve their localization accuracy: such as moving only in well-lit locations, observing texture-rich objects etc.

                                I am currently working on developing a collaborative localization pipeline that is applicable for a swarm of multirotor aerial vehicles with a monocular camera as the only sensor required on each vehicle. Feature detection and matching are performed between the individual views, thus allowing for reconstruction of the surrounding environment which is then used for localizing the moving vehicles within a group. The vehicles are also capable of computing relative poses between each other and fusing them with individual pose estimation for enhanced accuracy.

                                In collaboration with Mayo Clinic Arizona, I am working on developing a fully real time computer vision based tracking system for cancer tumors. The target application is to control a state-of-the-art proton beam targeting system according to tumor motion arising from the breathing cycles of the patient and other kinds of natural organ motion. Computer vision techniques such as normalized cross correlation, image saliency maps etc. are utilized to track tiny fiducials implanted in the tumors through X-ray fluoroscopy. The tracking method is able to handle high amounts of noise and various types of markers in order to achieve accurate and real time tracking.

                                Ars Robotica was a collaboration between artists, theater performers and roboticists: to understand the fluidity and expressiveness of human movement and the possibility of its reproduction by robotic platforms. Using the Rethink Robotics Baxter as a test platform, we worked on defining and achieving human-like movement on the robot. We obtained training data from human performers through sensors all the way from a Microsoft Kinect to a 12 camera Optitrack system; which we then used to define a vocabulary of human motion. We later managed to express complex movements as a temporal combination of primitives: thus helping create a framework for autonomous interpretation and expression of human-like motion through Baxter.

                                As part of a team at the Extreme Environment Robotics Laboratory, I worked on the development of onboard firmware and ground station software for a subglacial lake and aquatic exploration robot called MSLED. MSLED consists of a submersible mothership/explorer combination, and uses MEMS sensor and imaging technologies to investigate deep, remote and chemically challenging aquatic environments. MSLED was deployed successfully twice in Lake McMurdo, Antarctica as part of the WISSARD program, while WISSARD played a crucial role in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=132267">discovery of subglacial life under the Antarctic ice</a>.

                                I led a team of graduate students on a project involving hardware and software design of expendable "volcanic monitor" capsules which monitor and transmit data about rapidly evolving volcanic conditions. The monitors are equipped with a number of sensors (seismic, gas, temperature etc.) and use a minimal data packaging and transmission protocol using the Iridium satellite modems that allows for real time compilation and dissemination of scientific data. Volcano monitors were deployed in Nicaragua, Italy, Iceland and Greenland.
